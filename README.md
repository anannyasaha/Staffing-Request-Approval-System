# Staffing Request Approval System

A Microsoft Power Automate solution that streamlines staffing request approvals for regional courts and corporate headquarters, transforming inefficient manual processes into an automated, transparent workflow.

## Overview

This system replaces a cumbersome Microsoft Access-based approval process with an integrated Power Platform solution. The original system required approvers to download Excel files, manually process approvals, and send them via emailâ€”creating compatibility issues and reporting nightmares. 

The new automated solution improved process efficiency by **38%** while providing complete audit trails and real-time tracking capabilities.

## Features

- **Intelligent Workflow Routing**: Automatically routes requests through one of three approval workflows based on form responses
- **Multi-Level Approvals**: Supports up to six levels of approval hierarchy with escalation to corporate headquarters
- **Teams Integration**: All approvals processed directly within Microsoft Teams interface
- **Manual Delegation**: Approvers can reassign requests to colleagues when unavailable
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All comments and decisions stored in SharePoint for reporting
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Instant notifications via Teams and Outlook
- **Knowledge Base**: Dedicated SharePoint site with instructional videos and FAQs
- **Budget-Based Escalation**: Requests exceeding regional budgets automatically escalate to corporate
