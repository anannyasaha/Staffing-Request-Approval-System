# Staffing Request Approval System

A Microsoft Power Automate solution that streamlines staffing request approvals for regional courts and corporate headquarters, transforming inefficient manual processes into an automated, transparent workflow.

## Overview

This system replaces a cumbersome Microsoft Access-based approval process with an integrated Power Platform solution. The original system required approvers to download Excel files, manually process approvals, and send them via emailâ€”creating compatibility issues and reporting nightmares. 

The new automated solution improved process efficiency by **38%** while providing complete audit trails and real-time tracking capabilities.

## Features

- **Intelligent Workflow Routing**: Automatically routes requests through one of three approval workflows based on form responses
- **Multi-Level Approvals**: Supports up to six levels of approval hierarchy with escalation to corporate headquarters
- **Teams Integration**: All approvals processed directly within Microsoft Teams interface
- **Manual Delegation**: Approvers can reassign requests to colleagues when unavailable
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All comments and decisions stored in SharePoint for reporting
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Instant notifications via Teams and Outlook
- **Knowledge Base**: Dedicated SharePoint site with instructional videos and FAQs
- **Budget-Based Escalation**: Requests exceeding regional budgets automatically escalate to corporate

## Technical Architecture

### Components Used
- **Microsoft Forms**: Initial request capture
- **Power Automate**: Workflow orchestration and business logic
- **Microsoft Teams**: Approval interface and notifications
- **SharePoint**: Data storage and reporting
- **Outlook**: Email notifications
- **Power BI**: Analytics and reporting dashboards

### Workflow Logic
1. Regional court managers submit requests via Microsoft Form
2. System analyzes responses and determines appropriate workflow path
3. Requests route through hierarchical approval levels
4. Each approver provides rationale and comments

6. Final approval triggers notifications and data logging
7. All data stored in SharePoint for audit and reporting
